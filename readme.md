# Sunrise Plugin
This plugin was created by scouring GitHub for other plugin examples and mashing them into one, with a few hooks specific to Halo.
Also, this is my first time modding an Xbox, so the resulting code is quite disorganized. Fortunately the plugin doesn't need to do an awful lot.

# TODO:
- Implement some kind of ping web request so that the server can track player population.
- Add a lsp hook for Reach.
